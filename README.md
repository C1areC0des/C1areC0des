I'm Clare and I dived into coding a couple of years ago and haven't looked back!  It excites me that there is so much to learn whatever direction you take.

I have a focus on front-end and love transforming designs in fully-functional, pixel-perfect pages and components.

At work we are currently re-building our pages in Next.js and React, with Redux Toolkit for state management and for unit testing we are using Jest and React Testing Library.

At home I'm trying to understand more about SEO and Accessibility and also learning GSAP animations, which is a lot of fun!
